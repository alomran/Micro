While hajj must be performed once in a lifetime by all able-bodied Muslims, umrah can be performed at any time of the year.\r\n\r\nMore than two million umrah pilgrims arrived in the kingdom during the current season, and for the first time they were allowed to travel to any city in the kingdom for up to 15 days after visiting Mecca and Medina, a step to encourage more spending.\r\n\r\nThe authorities also hope the rail line will revive one struggling urban project, the King Abdullah Economic City, where the train will stop. The city was launched a decade ago but has [struggled to attract investment and residents](https://www.ft.com/content/ae48574c-58e6-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8).\r\n\r\nPersuading foreign investors to come to the kingdom has become increasingly difficult as the country continues to deal with the fallout from killing journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but officials hope that ramping up state spending would boost growth and investors would eventually come around. \r\n\r\nThe government [unveiled an expansionary budget](https://www.ft.com/content/3cf9cffa-02da-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1) earlier this month, pledging to increase spending on infrastructure and transportation by 28% in 2019. It wants to take advantage of higher oil prices to boost economic growth in the private sector and reduce unemployment which remains high at 12.9%.\r\n\r\n“2018 was a year to contain unemployment among Saudis, but there is good news as we continue a full restructuring of the labour market,” said economy minister Mohammed al-Tuwaijri who predicted that unemployment rate would begin to go down next year.\r\n\r\nThe [Haramain train](https://www.hhr.sa/sites/sro/Pages/home.aspx) will also stop at another landmark infrastructure project: the new Jeddah international airport, which started serving some local routes over the summer and is expected to become fully operational by the second quarter of 2019.\r\n\r\nThe old terminal, built in 1981, has struggled to cope with increasing demand and fallen into disrepair in recent years. “I don’t blame travellers for complaining about the current airport,” Prince Khaled said. “It has not been upgraded in a very long time.”\r\n\r\nThe new terminal, built over an area of 810,000 sq m and cost $9.6 billion, is expected to serve around 80m passengers annually, more than double current capacity.\r\n\r\n“The current airport cuts our legs short. It incapacitates the city from fulfilling its full potential,” said Nidhal Taibah, a founding partner at the Saudi office of EHAF Consulting Engineers. “The new airport will make a huge difference.”\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2018/4051f0ec3c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"449\" alt=\"\" />\n",

The videos were soon followed by tweets claiming that a coup was taking place, some of them [falsely attributed](https://twitter.com/joshledermanAP/status/987791893894443008) to the Associated Press.\n\nOne of these tweets that were forwarded to me claimed that “Royal Saudi Land Forces (KSA) Lieutenant General Allukas Nepils is leading the military push to oust King Salman.” Anyone who knows Saudi Arabia or speaks Arabic would easily detect that the name mentioned there does not sound real.\n\nOthers raised questions about the official statement because the gunfire in the videos sounded too intense if the target was a toy drone as police said, but I think it should not be surprising that a security checkpoint might overreact to a drone near the royal palace. Journalist Danny Gold [said](https://twitter.com/DGisSERIOUS/status/987809997504598017) he was with Iraqi troops when they were trying to shoot down an ISIS drone and “the pace and amount of fire in the video i just saw sounds consistent to what i witnessed.”\n\nReuters later reported that the king was spending time at his farm in Diriya and was [not at the palace](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-security-king/saudi-king-was-not-in-palace-during-drone-incident-saudi-official-idUSKBN1HS0QE) during the incident.\n",
